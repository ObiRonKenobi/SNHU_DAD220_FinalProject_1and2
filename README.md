Structured Database Environments


In Project One, we created a database using MySQL in an Ubuntu terminal.

We created tables with appropriate foreign and primary keys and populated them with
data from CSV files containing customer, order, and returns information for 
Quantigration.

In Project Two, we conducted an analysis of this data on behalf of Quantigration's
product manager.

We viewed order and return information by state.
We also viewed return percentages by SKU.

The analysis provided insight into possible product defectiveness or  abuse of return 
policy.

Further analysis is required to determine the exact cause of high return percentages.
